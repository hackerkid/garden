<ul>
<li>rolling upgrades - Deploy the new version to a few nodes at time. Make sure that the new version is running smoothly for all.</li>
<li>backward compatibility - New code can read data written by the old code.</li>
<li>forward compatiblity - Old code can read data written by new code.</li>
<li>Programs normally work with data in 2 representations

<ul>
<li>memory - Data is kept in structs, arrays, lists, hash table etc.

<ul>
<li>Optimized for efficent access by the CPU normally using a pointer.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>sequence of bytes - When you want to send the data over the network or store in a file.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Translation from in memory representation to seqeuence of byes is called encoding. Also called as serializing, marshaling.</li>
<li>The reverse is called as decoding, parsing, deserialization, unmarshaling etc.</li>
<li>Many languages support encoding/decoding.

<ul>
<li>eg Pickle of Python, Marshal of Ruby</li>
<li>They are convinent cause you need to write minimal code.</li>
<li>But there are a lot of issues

<ul>
<li>Highly dependent on the language.</li>
<li>Decoding involves creating new classes which can be used by an attacker to execute random code.</li>
<li>Versioning of data is an afterthought.</li>
<li>Encoding and decoding is not very efficent.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Alternative is to use standard encodings like JSON, <a href='xml.html'>XML</a> etc that are supported by many programming languages.</li>
