<li>I came across the concept of <strong>yak shaving</strong> in Drew DeVault&rsquo;s  <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2020/08/17/Engineers-solve-problems.html">blog post</a>.</li>
<li>Yak shaving is a pointless activity that solves a problem, that solves another problem, that solves another problem and after several recursion later solves the actual problem.</li>
<li>The most common example of this is you trying to fix a bug in an open source library that you use in one your our projects.</li>
<li>Most developers stop after they find a big a third party library and give up.</li>
<li>But that&rsquo;s not what you should do. Developers are paid to solve problems. And it&rsquo;s your responasbility to solve the problem no matter what. If that means fixing a bug in the GCC compiler or creating a PR in a NPM project so be it.</li>
<li>Some of the best engineers I have met are very good at this process.</li>
<li>I have seen them creating PRs in all kind of libraries without waiting for the maintainer to fix the problem.</li>
